Now the world is getting like a village which can call a global village. As a result, we feel in touch with one another. But there present also some negative reviews. Some people use a mobile phone in the wrong way. They do the crime, terrorism over the mobile phone. Radiation which comes out from a mobile phone during use is not good for health. Sometimes it causes cancer and abnormalities. A mobile phone is a valuable blessing for us.</bdo></b></p></article>
